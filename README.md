# Re-randomizable El-Gamal
This repository presents a rerandomizable version of the El-Gamal public key encryption scheme.  

__Remark__: the core code is based on BouncyCastle. Therefore, if the BouncyCastle code is audited, the core functionalities of this repository are also fine. The _rerand_ function, however, is not audited. This repository should be used for research purposes.
